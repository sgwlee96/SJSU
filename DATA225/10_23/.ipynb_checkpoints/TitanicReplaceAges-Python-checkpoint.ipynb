    "# Replace missing ages\n",
    "#### We analyze the passenger survival data from the sinking of the Titanic to discover how survival, sex, age, and passenger class are correlated. Was it \"women and children first\" into the lifeboats? The CVS file `TitanicSurvivors.csv` contains one record per passenger, and each passenger has a name (maximum 31 characters) and three attributes: survived (yes or no), sex (male or female), age, and passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd). The data is sorted first by passenger class and then by name. The first few lines of the file:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "#### As shown by the two pairwise correlation matrices, the age attribute correlates **slightly better** with each of the other attributes if we replace each missing person's age by the survived subgroup's average age. Age is the worse predictor of survival. Age is much better at predicting a person's passenger class. A person's sex is the best predictor of survival."
